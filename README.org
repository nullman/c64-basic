* BASIC Programs for the C64

  See the "Build and Run" sections of [[file:c64-basic.org][c64-basic.org]] to see how to build, clean,
  and run these applications using the VICE emulator. In general you follow
  these steps:

  Build with =make=.

  Clean with =make clean=.

  Run with =x64sc NAME.prg=.

  All files are generated from [[file:c64-basic.org][c64-basic.org]] using Emacs' org-mode literate
  programming system to "tangle" them.
